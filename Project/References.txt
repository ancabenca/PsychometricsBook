Info about the data:
BFI- explained

The questionnaire consists of 44 items, with eight items relating to extraversion, nine to conscientiousness, nine to agreeableness, eight to neuroticism, and ten to openness. Each statement is rated on a five-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

The BFI-close questionnaire is very similar to the regular BFI questionnaire, but it differs only in terms of who completes it. The BFI-close is completed by a person who knows the participant well and is close to them (a relative, friend, etc.), answering questions and evaluating the participantâ€™s personality traits.

hey, sending the file classifying Western and Eastern Slovenian participants. Also, just so you know, the scores are all already reversed, so we dont need to do that(:
