# R code and datasets for the book "Computational aspects of psychometric methods. With R."

This repository contains the `R` code and the datasets used in Martinkova and Hladka's "Computational aspects of psychometric methods. With R", published with Chapman & Hall / CRC Press in 2023. For more information and materials, see the book webpage: https://www.cs.cas.cz/comps/CAPMbook 

The `R` code is separated by chapters. Code for installation of necessary `R` libraries is included in the `A-InstallPackages.R` file. Some introductory code with examples from Appendix are included in the `A-IntroductionToR.R` file. Code for each chapter (in `Ch*.R` files) includes lines for loading the packages needed in that chapter. 

Datasets are stored in folders. The `.csv` files may be used in the interactive `ShinyItemAnalysis` application. 

All the files may be downloaded as a `.zip` file by clicking `Code` and then clicking `Download ZIP`. Alternatively, individual chapters can be downloaded separately by clicking on the name of the `R` file, then clicking the `Raw` button, and finally saving that page as a `.R` file.
